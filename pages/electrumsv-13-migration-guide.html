between the older versions of ElectrumSV 1.2, and the new versions of ElectrumSV 1.3.</p>
<p>The current version of ElectrumSV at the time of writing, is 1.3.6, and you should only ever
download it from electrumsv.io.</p>

<div class="section" id="migrating-an-existing-wallet-from-1-2-5-or-earlier">
<h2>Migrating an existing wallet from 1.2.5 (or earlier)</h2>
<p>All past Electrum Core and Electron Cash wallets that predate the Bitcoin SV split should open,
not just wallets created or last used in ElectrumSV versions up to 1.2.5.</p>
<p>There are two known cases where wallet migration can fail:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Incomplete wallets. If someone opens a wallet that was closed mid-synchronisation, we have no
way to fill in the gaps and have to declare a migration failure. Your only recourse is to first
go back to 1.2.5 and open the wallet and let it completely synchronise, and retry. If that does
not solve the problem, report the issue to us and we’ll work through it.</li>
<li>Coinbase transactions. The migration process lacked test cases for wallets that contained these,
and would error. This has been fixed in Github where the source code is maintained, and will be
fixed in 1.3.2 and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="select-and-open-your-wallet">
<h3>Select and open your wallet</h3>
<p>Start up ElectrumSV and make sure you are on the wallet selection page.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the wallet selection screen of the wallet wizard." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/wallet-wizard-selection.png" />
<p class="caption">The wallet selection page.</p>
</div>
<p>If your wallet is in the list of “Recently Opened Wallets”, double click on it to open it. If
you used the keyboard to select the entry, press the enter key to open it. Otherwise, if you
are the thorough type, once it is selected through any mean click on the “Open Selected Wallet”
button to open it.</p>
<p>If your wallet is not present in the list of “Recently Opened Wallets”, click on the “Open Other
Wallet” button to locate and open it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-a-mandatory-password-if-it-has-no-password">
<h3>Add a mandatory password if it has no password</h3>
<p>Once you have opened your existing wallet from ElectrumSV 1.2 or earlier, if your wallet was
previously lacking a password, now we force you to add one. This also applies to hardware and
watch-only wallets, where there is no key or seed word data to encrypt.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the password dialog for a to-be migrated wallet without one." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/add-password-wallet-migration.png" />
<p class="caption">Add a password to your wallet.</p>
</div>
<p>If your wallet already has a password, you will be asked to provide it so that it can be opened
by ElectrumSV to migrate it. This existing password will be reused for securing and passwording
the migrated version.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wait-for-the-migration-to-complete">
<h3>Wait for the migration to complete</h3>
<p>This step should only take a few seconds. It is very unlikely anyone has a wallet that takes
longer.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the in-progress wallet migration page of the wallet wizard." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/wallet-wizard-migrating.png" />
<p class="caption">The migration process in action.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migration-is-successfully-completed">
<h3>Migration is successfully completed</h3>
<p>Once the migration has completed successfully, the “Finish” button will become enabled, and the
user can click it to open the wallet. It may take a few seconds where the wallet opening UI
closes and you can see nothing while your migrated wallet is loaded. Please wait patiently —
we should definitely add an interim user interface here and please remind us if we do not.</p>

<p>If you see a red progress bar, and the migration fails, please scroll up to the start of this
migration topic and follow the instructions there about reporting it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewing-the-successfully-migrated-wallet">
<h3>Viewing the successfully migrated wallet</h3>
<p>After your wallet has been opened, your main wallet window will open and it will synchronise
with the blockchain.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the wallet window for a successfully migrated wallet." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/migrated-wallet.png" />
<p class="caption">A successfully migrated wallet from some version of ElectrumSV 1.2.</p>
</div>
<p>Congratulations, you have successfully migrated your wallet. You will note that the user
interface now has a list of accounts on the left hand side, although we currently limit
it to one account for now. In the future a wallet will be able to contain multiple accounts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-wallet">
<h2>Creating a new wallet</h2>
<p>With ElectrumSV 1.3 a wallet is now a container for your accounts, so this shows you how to
create an empty wallet with no accounts. You will want to add an account to it, to start
using it.</p>
<div class="section" id="choosing-the-location-and-file-name">
<h3>Choosing the location and file name</h3>
<p>The first step is to choose where to store your wallet, and what it’s file name should be.
If you choose not to store your wallet in the default location that ElectrumSV uses, it is
likely that you will quickly be able to find it again in the “Recently Opened Wallets” list
when you open it again in the future.</p>
<p>Start off at the wallet selection page.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the wallet selection page of the wallet wizard." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/wallet-wizard-selection.png" />
<p class="caption">The wallet selection page.</p>
</div>
<p>Click on &quot;Create New Wallet&quot;. You will be presented with a file dialog that lets you choose
where your wallet will be stored, and what it will be named. It defaults to the standard
ElectrumSV wallet location on your operating system. Enter a file name, and click “Save”
(or press the enter key).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the file dialog for selecting where a newly created wallet goes." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/wallet-wizard-create-dialog.png" />
<p class="caption">The wallet creation file dialog.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-a-mandatory-password">
<h3>Add a mandatory password</h3>
<p>The next step is setting a password for your new wallet. We require a password and there is
no way to opt out, but you can always enter something like “password” or “123456” if you wish.
This is also required for hardware and watch-only wallets, where there is no key or seed word
data to encrypt.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the password dialog for a new wallet creation." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/add-password-wallet-creation.png" />
<p class="caption">The wallet creation password dialog.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have entered a password, and confirmed it, the “OK” button will become enabled and
you can click it (or just press the enter key) to open the new wallet.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of a newly created wallet." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/new-wallet.png" />
<p class="caption">The newly created wallet.</p>
</div>
<p>Congratulations, you have created a new empty wallet. It will not be usable until you have
created an account, and various parts of the user interface will indicate this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-standard-account">
<h2>Creating a new “Standard” account</h2>
<p>If you are reading this, you likely have a new wallet that has no accounts, and you want to
add one to it.</p>
<p>We support addition of a wide variety of account types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A new “Standard” account. This is the equivalent of creating a new ElectrumSV seed-word
based wallet in 1.2.5 and earlier.</li>
<li>A multi-signature account. Use this if you are creating a new multi-signature account,
or restoring an existing one from master public keys, seed words and so on.</li>
<li>Importing from text. Use this to import your seed words, whether Electrum seed words,
BIP39 seed words from another wallet, private keys, public keys, master public keys, master
private keys, and so on.</li>
<li>Importing a hardware wallet. If you have an existing hardware wallet that has a seed set
up on it, then you can use this to add an account that links to it and uses it to sign.
If you have a hardware wallet that does not have a seed set up on it, you should also be
able to use this to set it up unless the device is a Ledger. Do not buy a Ledger.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="adding-an-account">
<h3>Adding an account</h3>
<p>In the top-left-hand corner of your wallet window, you will see the “Add Account” button.
Click it and it will open the account wizard which allows all supported types of accounts
to be created.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot highlighting the “Add Account” button in the wallet window." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/new-wallet.png" />

<p>The account wizard offers four different types of account addition, at the time of writing.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-the-new-standard-account">
<h3>Creating the new “Standard” account</h3>
<p>Double-click on the “Standard” entry to proceed. Or if you prefer to work for it, click the
“Next” button or press the enter key. You will be asked for your password so that the generated
seed words and private key data can be encrypted into your wallet. This also verifies you have
the ability to really use this wallet, and should able to add an account.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the password confirmation dialog." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/password-confirmation-dialog.png" />
<p class="caption">Confirm your password dialog.</p>
</div>
<p>You will immediately see that the account has been added to your wallet. You will note that at
no point did you have to copy down your new seed words, or confirm them. You will be reminded
to back them up by the wallet, and can do so at your leisure and own risk.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="backing-up-your-seed-words">
<h3>Backing up your seed words</h3>
<p>The wallet window now has a notification center, which is used to remind you to deal with
important events, and point out how you can do it.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
<div class="section" id="follow-the-link-to-your-secured-data">
<h3>Follow the link to your secured data</h3>
<p>If you click on the “account’s secured data” link, it will take you directly to that secured
data. But first it will need your password so it can decrypt that data for display.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A screenshot of the password confirmation dialog." src="../pages/1.3-migration-guide/password-confirmation-dialog.png" />

<p>Congratulations, now write down the seed words somewhere safe. I recommend you look into
<a class="reference external" href="https://coinstorage.guru/">SAFEWORDS</a> to help you with this. You can dismiss the notification by clicking on the “X” in
it’s top right corner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accessing-your-master-public-key">
<h2>Accessing your master public key</h2>
<p>Master public keys are often used to create watch-only versions of a wallet, or to provide
to a service or application which needs to be enabled to generate keys on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> It should be noted that giving your master public key (otherwise known as an “xpub”)
to a service to it can solicit payments on your behalf is problematic. There is no way for
anyone paying to know if the service has been compromised or not, and whether the payment
scripts it provides are actually ones generated from your master public key. A similar concern
is the reliability of every employee of the service that has access to compromise your payments.
As a person wanting to pay who uses that service, you also have no guarantee you are paying to
who you think you are paying.</p>
<div class="section" id="viewing-the-master-public-key-for-a-given-account">
<h3>Viewing the master public key for a given account</h3>
<p>Open a context menu on the entry of the account you want the view the master public key for.
On Windows this is done with the right mouse button, while the mouse is over the entry.
On other platforms, it is likely a different button.</p>

<h2>Accessing your master private key/secured data</h2>
